# Wide review template for Pointer Events

Open an issue in the specification repository and copy the following issue body there, for tracking purposes.

------------------------

This is a meta issue to track [wide review](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#wide-review) for the [Pointer Events - Level 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents4/).

An important part of wide review is horizontal review from W3C's [key horizontal groups](https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review) listed below. Also feedback from other stakeholders is equally important and we're documenting some of such signals in this issue too. Additional pointers are welcome via comments.
